3. **OrganizationCards** - Organization selector
4. **OrganizationHeader** - Organization details
5. **InheritanceTree** - Inheritance visualization
6. **PrinciplesViewWithInheritance** - Principles with inheritance
7. **TermDiscussionManager** - Advanced term evolution
8. **TermRatificationVoting** - Voting system
9. **TermsView** - Basic term viewing

2. **PersonalTermDevelopment** - Complete but not integrated
3. **PersonalWorkspace** - Complete but not integrated
4. **RecentDiscussions** - Not used in current flow

### Redundant Components
1. **FeaturedDiscussion** - Redundant with github-compatible version
2. **PrinciplesView** - Replaced by PrinciplesViewWithInheritance

### Architecture Observations
1. **Mixed Integration**: Some components directly use governance data, others don't
2. **Personal Features**: Complete personal branch system exists but isn't connected
3. **Import Confusion**: Some components imported from wrong locations
4. **API Dependency**: Several components expect APIs that may not be implemented
5. **Complex Features**: TermDiscussionManager is the most sophisticated component

### Recommendations
1. Remove redundant components (FeaturedDiscussion, PrinciplesView)
2. Integrate or remove orphaned personal branch components
3. Standardize governance data access patterns
4. Fix import paths for consistency
5. Implement missing API endpoints or update components to read directly from dahao-governance
