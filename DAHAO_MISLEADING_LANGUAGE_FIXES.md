- "is" → "will be"
- "does" → "will do"
- "helps" → "will help"
- "enables" → "will enable"

### Phase Status
**Replace:**
- "Phase 1 Active/Current" → "Phase 1 Design/Concept"
- "Now" → "Planned"
- "Building" → "Designing"

## 6. Recommended Global Addition

Add a clear disclaimer to the site header or homepage:

```html
<div className="bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-950/20 border border-yellow-200 dark:border-yellow-800 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6">
  <p className="text-sm text-yellow-800 dark:text-yellow-200">
    <strong>Note:</strong> DAHAO is currently in the conceptual design phase. 
    This website demonstrates our vision through UI mockups and design concepts. 
    The platform functionality described here represents our future plans and is not yet operational.
  </p>

## 7. Priority Order for Fixes

   - API connection "Try it now" language
   - "Phase 1 Active" badges
   - Interactive examples suggesting live functionality
   - "Using DAHAO to Build DAHAO" claims

2. **Second Priority (Important - Yellow Items)**
   - "Get Started" CTAs
   - Present tense action items
   - "Ready to Join" language
   - Phase timing claims ("Now" vs "Planned")

3. **Third Priority (Minor - Green Items)**
   - General clarifications
   - Future tense adjustments
   - Conceptual framing improvements

## Implementation Notes

- All changes should maintain the aspirational and exciting tone while being clear about current status
- Use words like "vision," "concept," "planned," "future," and "envisioned"
- Avoid words that imply current functionality: "try," "start," "join," "connect"
- Consider adding visual indicators (badges, icons) to show conceptual vs implemented features
- Ensure consistency across all pages - if one page says "concept," all should reflect this

---

## Testing Checklist

After implementing fixes, verify:
- [ ] No CTAs suggest immediate action on non-existent features
- [ ] All interactive examples are clearly labeled as future/conceptual
- [ ] Phase descriptions accurately reflect design/concept status
- [ ] API integration mentions include "future" or "planned" language
- [ ] The overall message is clear: exciting vision, not yet built
