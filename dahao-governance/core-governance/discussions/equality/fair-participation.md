# Fair Participation Access

**Status:** Active Discussion
**Proposal:** Improve participation barriers for underrepresented groups
**Created:** 2024-12-08
**Author:** @equality_researcher

## Summary
Addressing barriers that prevent equal participation in DAHAO governance, particularly for non-technical users and economically disadvantaged participants.

## Identified Barriers
1. **Technical complexity** - GitHub and YAML requirements
2. **Time zone bias** - Synchronous discussions favor certain regions
3. **Language barriers** - English-only discussions
4. **Economic barriers** - Unpaid participation time

## Proposed Solutions
- Simplified web interface for non-technical users
- Asynchronous decision-making processes
- Multi-language support for key documents
- Participation incentive mechanisms

Current participation data shows 78% of active participants are from North America/Europe, despite global membership.

Adding voice-to-text options and screen reader compatibility should be part of any solution.

Geographic analysis confirms bias toward GMT-8 to GMT+2 time zones in synchronous activities.
Recommendation: Implement 48-hour decision windows with global notification system.
Impact assessment: Could increase participation by estimated 34%.

Participation time should be compensated through governance tokens or other value exchange mechanisms.

## Next Steps
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Multi-language translation pilot
- Token economic impact analysis
