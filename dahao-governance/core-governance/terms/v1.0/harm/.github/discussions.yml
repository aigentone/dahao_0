    title: "Expanding 'harm' definition to include systemic harm"
    body: |
      ## Current Gap
      
      The current definition of harm@v1.1 covers individual harm well, but lacks consideration for systemic and structural harm that affects communities and societies.
      
      ### Proposed Addition
      
      Add a new subsection to address:
      - Systemic discrimination
      - Environmental injustice
      - Economic exploitation patterns
      - Institutional bias
      
      ### References
      - Related to principle P003 (minimize harm)
      - Builds on equality@v1.0 definition
      
      What are your thoughts on this expansion?

            Strong support for this. Modern understanding of harm must include systemic patterns.
            
            I suggest we also consider:
            - Intergenerational harm
            - Digital/algorithmic bias
            - Cultural erasure

            While I support expanding the definition, we need to be careful about scope creep.
            
            How do we ensure the definition remains:
            1. Actionable
            2. Measurable
            3. Enforceable
            
            Perhaps we need a tiered approach?

    title: "Clarifying 'immediate' in harm prevention contexts"
    body: |
      The current definition uses "immediate harm" but this is ambiguous. 
      
      Does immediate mean:
      - Temporal (happening right now)?
      - Causal (direct consequence)?
      - Priority (most urgent)?
      
      This affects how we implement harm prevention in automated systems.

    title: "Historical context for harm definition evolution"
    body: |
      I think it would be valuable to document how our understanding of harm has evolved.
      
      Looking at the version history:
      - v1.0: Basic physical harm
      - v1.1: Added psychological harm
      - v1.2 (proposed): Systemic harm
      
      This shows a clear progression toward more comprehensive understanding.
