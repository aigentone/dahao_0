          The current v1.0 definition is too narrow. "Positive functioning" doesn't capture the full scope of what we mean by wellbeing.
          
          ## Issues with v1.0:
          - Only covers physical and mental dimensions
          - "Functioning" implies mere operation, not thriving
          - Misses social and environmental factors
          
          ## Proposed v1.1:
          "Holistic state of thriving across physical, mental, social, and environmental dimensions"
          
          This better reflects:
          - **Physical**: Health, vitality, bodily integrity
          - **Mental**: Emotional balance, cognitive capacity, purpose
          - **Social**: Relationships, community, belonging
          - **Environmental**: Healthy surroundings, sustainability

          Excellent expansion! This aligns with WHO's definition of health and modern wellbeing research.
          
          **Supporting evidence**:
          - Social connections are as important as physical health for longevity
          - Environmental factors significantly impact both physical and mental wellbeing
          - "Thriving" captures the positive psychology approach vs. just absence of problems
          
          ‚úÖ Strong support for v1.1

          Love the direction! Quick question about **environmental dimension** - does this include:
          - Physical environment (air, water, noise, etc.)?
          - Built environment (housing, workplace design)?
          - Natural environment access?
          - Social environment (community, culture)?
          
          Want to make sure we're clear on scope.

          @environmental_advocate Great clarification request! I'd include:
          
          **Environmental dimension encompasses**:
          - **Physical**: Clean air/water, safe surroundings, appropriate climate
          - **Built**: Accessible design, natural light, functional spaces
          - **Natural**: Access to nature, biodiversity, ecosystem health
          - **Toxic-free**: Freedom from pollutants, harmful substances
          
          **Note**: Social environment is covered under "social dimension" to avoid overlap.
          
          The key is that our external environment significantly shapes our capacity to thrive.

          This is important for cross-domain consistency. How does this relate to:
          
          - `core:harm@v1.1` - "reduction in wellbeing"
          - `welfare:suffering` - negative experience
          - `environment:sustainability` - long-term wellbeing
          
          We need these terms to work together coherently.

          @systems_architect Perfect question! Here's how they interconnect:
          
          **Wellbeing (positive baseline)**:
          - State we're trying to achieve and maintain
          - Multi-dimensional thriving
          
          **Harm (reduction from baseline)**:
          - Anything that reduces wellbeing
          - Can affect any dimension (physical, mental, social, environmental)
          
          **Suffering (conscious experience)**:
          - Subjective negative experience of wellbeing reduction
          - Extends `harm` with consciousness requirement
          
          **Sustainability (temporal dimension)**:
          - Maintaining/improving wellbeing over time
          - Inter-generational wellbeing responsibility
          
          They form a coherent framework! üéØ
