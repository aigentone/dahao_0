    title: "Turkey Municipal Veterinary Care System for Street Animals"
    body: |
      ## Summary
      Proposal for a comprehensive blockchain-verified municipal veterinary care system for street animals in Turkey. The system integrates with existing municipal infrastructure to provide transparent, token-governed healthcare for street animals through verified veterinary providers with blockchain-tracked treatment records and investment pool allocation.

      ## Proposed System Components
      1. **Municipal Veterinary Registration** - Authorized provider network with blockchain verification
      2. **Blockchain Treatment Tracking** - On-chain timestamps with off-chain medical data
      3. **Transparent Token Governance** - Investment pool allocation with public dashboard and token holder voting
      4. **Medical Data Sharing** - Anonymized research access with privacy protection

      ## Implementation Phases
      - **Phase 1**: 3-municipality pilot (Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir) - 6 months
      - **Phase 2**: Regional expansion to 15 municipalities - 12 months
      - **Phase 3**: National implementation across Turkey - 24 months

      ## Alignment with Five Freedoms
      1. Freedom from Hunger/Thirst - Emergency feeding protocols
      2. Freedom from Discomfort - Shelter improvements tracking
      3. Freedom from Pain/Disease - Medical intervention focus
      4. Freedom from Normal Behavior - Behavioral assessment integration
      5. Freedom from Fear/Distress - Stress-reduction protocols

            This addresses critical gaps in coordinated street animal care. Blockchain verification would eliminate payment delays we face with municipal reimbursements. Investment pool governance could ensure stable funding. Need extensive technical training though.

            Finally, transparency! Current municipal processes are opaque. Citizens never know if tax money actually helps animals. This token governance system could revolutionize animal welfare investment allocation.

            Medical data sharing component excellent for research and population health monitoring. Could integrate with university research programs. Privacy protections adequate.

    title: "Outdoor Access Requirement for Farm Animals"
    body: |
      ## Summary
      Proposal to establish outdoor access as a mandatory requirement under the "freedom to express normal behavior" principle.

      ## Proposed Requirements
      - Minimum daily outdoor access: 6 hours for social species
      - Weather-appropriate shelter available in outdoor areas
      - Pasture rotation to prevent overgrazing
      - Species-specific outdoor environment design

      ## Five Freedoms Analysis

      ### Freedom to Express Normal Behavior ‚úÖ
      Outdoor access directly supports natural behaviors:
      - Foraging and exploration
      - Social interactions in natural setting
      - Thermoregulation behaviors
      - Exercise and locomotion

      ### Freedom from Discomfort ü§î
      Requires careful implementation:
      - Weather protection necessary
      - Predator protection measures
      - Terrain suitable for species

      ## Current Voting Status
      - ‚úÖ 75% approval
      - ü§î Pending practical implementation guidelines

            **AI Analysis - Animal Behavior Assessment**
            
            Cross-species analysis confirms outdoor access benefits across all farm animals studied.
            Risk assessment: Weather-related welfare risks can be mitigated with proper shelter design.
            Economic impact: Initial infrastructure costs offset by reduced veterinary expenses over 3-year period.
