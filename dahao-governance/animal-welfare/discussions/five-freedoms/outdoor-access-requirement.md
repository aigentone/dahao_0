**Created:** 2024-12-12
**Author:** @farm_welfare_specialist

## Summary
Proposal to establish outdoor access as a mandatory requirement under the "freedom to express normal behavior" principle.

## Proposed Requirements
- Minimum daily outdoor access: 6 hours for social species
- Weather-appropriate shelter available in outdoor areas
- Pasture rotation to prevent overgrazing
- Species-specific outdoor environment design

## Five Freedoms Analysis

### Freedom to Express Normal Behavior âœ…
Outdoor access directly supports natural behaviors:
- Foraging and exploration
- Social interactions in natural setting
- Thermoregulation behaviors
- Exercise and locomotion

### Freedom from Discomfort ðŸ¤”
Requires careful implementation:
- Weather protection necessary
- Predator protection measures
- Terrain suitable for species

Cross-species analysis confirms outdoor access benefits across all farm animals studied.
Risk assessment: Weather-related welfare risks can be mitigated with proper shelter design.
Economic impact: Initial infrastructure costs offset by reduced veterinary expenses over 3-year period.

Measurement protocol recommendation:
- Daily outdoor access time logging
- Behavioral observation during outdoor periods
- Weather condition impact tracking
- Long-term health outcome correlation
