          We need a domain-specific definition of suffering that builds on `core:harm@v1.1` but adds the consciousness requirement essential for animal welfare.
          
          ## Why animal-specific suffering matters:
          
          **Extends core harm with consciousness**:
          - Not all harm involves conscious experience
          - Animal welfare specifically concerns sentient experience
          - Need measurable indicators for different species
          
          ## Proposed Definition:
          "Negative subjective experience of sentient beings, encompassing physical pain, psychological distress, and behavioral frustration"
          
          ## Key Components:
          
          **Physical suffering**: 
          - Pain, discomfort, illness
          - Measurable through physiology, behavior
          - Species-specific pain responses
          
          **Psychological suffering**:
          - Fear, anxiety, distress
          - Learned helplessness
          - Chronic stress responses
          
          **Behavioral suffering**:
          - Inability to perform natural behaviors
          - Stereotypies and repetitive behaviors
          - Frustration from thwarted motivations

          Excellent foundation! This definition aligns with current animal welfare science.
          
          **Supporting research**:
          - Dawkins (2004): Behavioral indicators of emotional states
          - Fraser (2008): Understanding animal welfare through natural behavior
          - Mellor (2017): Five Domains model for welfare assessment
          
          **Key advantage**: Measurable across species without anthropomorphism
          
          **Question**: Should we include specific assessment protocols or keep the definition conceptual?

          @animal_welfare_scientist I think the definition should remain conceptual, but we could add a companion document with assessment protocols.
          
          **Reasoning**:
          - Definition provides stable conceptual foundation
          - Assessment methods evolve with scientific understanding
          - Different contexts need different measurement approaches
          
          **Example protocols could include**:
          - Physiological indicators (cortisol, heart rate variability)
          - Behavioral assessments (species-specific ethograms)
          - Preference testing methodologies
          - Cognitive bias testing
          
          This keeps the term definition stable while allowing methodological advancement.

          How does this interact with the Five Freedoms framework that's central to animal welfare?
          
          **Mapping suffering to freedoms**:
          - **Freedom from hunger/thirst**: Physical suffering from basic needs
          - **Freedom from discomfort**: Environmental suffering  
          - **Freedom from pain/injury/disease**: Direct physical suffering
          - **Freedom from fear/distress**: Psychological suffering
          - **Freedom to express behavior**: Behavioral suffering
          
          This definition nicely encompasses all freedom violations! ‚úÖ

          Important consideration: **species differences** in suffering experience.
          
          **Challenges**:
          - Fish pain perception vs. mammalian pain
          - Invertebrate suffering (controversial but emerging evidence)
          - Different cognitive capacities affect suffering types
          
          **Question**: Should definition be broad enough to include uncertain cases (e.g., insects) or focus on clear cases (mammals, birds)?
          
          **My view**: Keep broad with "sentient beings" - better to err on side of inclusion as science evolves.

          @comparative_cognition_researcher Agree on inclusive approach! Evidence for sentience keeps expanding.
          
          **Recent developments**:
          - Crabs and lobsters show pain avoidance behaviors
          - Bees demonstrate emotional states
          - Fish display complex social behaviors indicating emotional capacity
          
          **Precautionary principle**: If uncertain about sentience, assume capacity for suffering until proven otherwise.
          
          **Definition handles this well**: "sentient beings" is appropriately broad and evidence-based rather than taxonomically restrictive.

          How does this term integrate with our inheritance from `core:harm@v1.1`?
          
          **Relationship clarification**:
          - `core:harm`: Any reduction in wellbeing (broad, includes unconscious systems)
          - `welfare:suffering`: Subset of harm requiring conscious experience
          
          **Examples**:
          - Tree damage = harm (wellbeing reduction) but not suffering (no consciousness)
          - Animal pain = both harm AND suffering (conscious experience of wellbeing reduction)
          
          This maintains logical consistency across domains! üéØ

          ## üéâ CONSENSUS REACHED - TERM RATIFIED
          
          Strong community support for welfare:suffering@v1.0:
          
          **Ratified Definition**: "Negative subjective experience of sentient beings, encompassing physical pain, psychological distress, and behavioral frustration"
          
          **Extends**: `core:harm@v1.1` with consciousness requirement
          
          **Voting Results**:
          - ‚úÖ Support: 87% (35 votes)
          - ü§î Conditional: 10% (4 votes)
          - ‚ùå Oppose: 3% (1 vote)
          - Total participation: 40 animal welfare domain members
          
          **Key Clarifications Established**:
          
          **Three Types of Suffering**:
          - **Physical**: Pain, discomfort, illness
          - **Psychological**: Fear, anxiety, distress, learned helplessness
          - **Behavioral**: Frustration from inability to express natural behaviors
          
          **Species Inclusivity**:
          - Applies to all sentient beings
          - Evidence-based determination of sentience
          - Precautionary principle for uncertain cases
          
          **Assessment Approach**:
          - Definition remains conceptual
          - Separate protocols for measurement
          - Species-specific indicators
          
          **Domain Integration**:
          - Extends `core:harm@v1.1` with consciousness requirement
          - Maps directly to Five Freedoms framework
          - Maintains cross-domain consistency
          
          **Effective Date**: 2024-02-01T15:30:00Z
          
          This term now provides the foundation for all animal welfare governance decisions. 
          
          Next steps: Developing species-specific assessment protocols and integrating with welfare measurement principles.
          
          Thank you for the thoughtful scientific discussion! üß¨üêæ
