discussions:
  - id: "core-governance-disc-1"
    title: "Fair Participation Framework"
    body: |
      ## Key Areas
      - **Equal Voice**: Ensuring all participants have meaningful opportunity
      - **Accessibility**: Removing barriers to participation
      - **Representation**: Balanced perspectives across stakeholder groups
      - **Process Transparency**: Clear decision-making procedures
      
      ## Current Challenges
      1. Information asymmetries
      2. Technical barriers
      3. Time zone and scheduling constraints
      4. Language and cultural barriers

    title: "AI Decision Auditability"
    body: |
      ## Requirements
      - All AI decisions must be traceable
      - Decision logic must be explainable
      - Audit trails required for governance

# AI Decision Auditability

## Core Requirements
- **Traceability**: Every AI decision must have complete audit trail
- **Explainability**: Decision logic must be interpretable by humans
- **Accountability**: Clear responsibility chain for AI outcomes

## Implementation Logic
1. Decision logging with timestamps
2. Input/output parameter recording
3. Algorithm version tracking
4. Human oversight checkpoints

... [detailed implementation omitted]
```
