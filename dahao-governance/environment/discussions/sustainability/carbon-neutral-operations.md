# Carbon Neutral Operations Requirement

**Status:** Final Voting
**Proposal:** Mandatory carbon neutrality for all DAHAO-governed operations
**Created:** 2024-12-05
**Author:** @climate_scientist

## Summary
Proposal to require carbon neutrality as minimum standard for all DAHAO operations, with path toward carbon negative by 2030.

## Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1 (2025):** Carbon footprint assessment for all operations
- **Phase 2 (2026):** 50% emission reduction through efficiency improvements
- **Phase 3 (2027):** Carbon neutrality through verified offsets and remaining reductions
- **Phase 4 (2028-2030):** Transition to carbon negative operations

## Measurement Framework
```yaml
carbon_accounting:
  scope_1: "direct_emissions_from_operations"
  scope_2: "purchased_electricity_emissions"  
  scope_3: "value_chain_emissions_full_assessment"
  verification: "third_party_annual_audit"
  reporting: "quarterly_public_disclosure"
```

Current DAHAO operations produce estimated 2,400 tons CO2e annually. With efficiency improvements and renewable energy, we can achieve 80% reduction before needing offsets.

Cost analysis shows $240k investment for renewable energy transition, with 7-year payback period through energy savings.

Cross-domain impact assessment:
- Animal welfare: Renewable energy aligns with sustainability principles
- Core governance: Transparency requirements support public carbon reporting
- Cost-benefit analysis: 15% operational cost increase in year 1, 12% savings by year 3

Suggest phased implementation to spread costs. Phase 1 assessment costs only $45k and provides baseline for decision-making.

Regulatory analysis: Anticipated carbon pricing policies make early action economically advantageous.
Risk assessment: Climate liability risks exceed implementation costs by 3:1 ratio.

**@community_member (Human)**

Support the proposal but request clear communication about how this aligns with DAHAO's transparency principles - all carbon data should be publicly accessible.
