markdown# DAHAO Website Content Update Project

## Project Overview
Update all website content to reflect the new system architecture based on:
- Personal DAHAO branches (not just forum-style)
- Progressive governance pipeline (Personal → Public Pool → Investment → Governance)
- AI agent value differentiation (Personal vs System AI)
- **DUAL BENEFIT TOKEN ECONOMICS** (not sponsor system)
- Terms-as-discussions democratic evolution
- Avalanche subchain creation for successful DAHAOs

## CRITICAL ECONOMIC MODEL CORRECTION

### WRONG Terminology to Remove Completely:
- "Sponsor system"
- "Sponsor approval"
- "Budget allocation by sponsors"
- Any reference to "sponsorship"

### CORRECT Economic System to Implement:

#### Dual Benefit Investment Model:
1. **Investment Pools**: People invest in DAHAO tokens, not sponsorship
2. **Token Value Growth**: DAHAO success increases token price
3. **Avalanche Subchain**: Automatic blockchain deployment for successful DAHAOs
4. **Governance-Managed**: Token holders control fund allocation decisions
5. **Contributor Rewards**: Contributors earn tokens for valuable work
6. **Dual Benefit Mechanism**: Investors profit + community gets more resources

#### Alex Investment Example (USE THIS):
Alex invests $1,000 → buys 1000 DAHAO tokens @ $1 each
1 month later: Token appreciates 5x ($1 → $5) due to DAHAO success
Alex sells $2,000 worth → Alex profits $1,000 (2x return)
Remaining value: $3,000 stays in system for community work
Result: Alex profits + $3,000 available for DAHAO operations = WIN-WIN

#### Token Reward Distribution:
- Governance participation → Token allocation from community pool
- Development work → Token payment + impact bonuses
- Community value creation → Token incentives + reputation
- Growth contribution → Token share + growth bonuses

## Phase 1: Core Pages Update (Priority 1)

### 1. HOME PAGE (/) - Strategic Repositioning

**Current Problems:**
- Describes system as "forum-like platform"
- Missing personal DAHAO branch concept
- Uses incorrect "sponsor system" terminology
- No token economics explanation

**Required Updates:**

#### Hero Section:
- **FROM**: "forum-like platform"
- **TO**: "personal governance workspaces + investment pools"

#### Core Concepts - ADD:
Personal DAHAO Branches:

Fork governance frameworks to match your values
Develop terms and ethics in your personal workspace
AI agents represent YOUR complete value system
Contribute to investment pool growth


#### Economic Section - REPLACE:
REMOVE: "Sponsor system for serious proposals"
ADD: "Dual Benefit Investment Model"
The Dual Benefit Model:

Profit and social impact amplify each other
Investors buy DAHAO tokens, profit as project succeeds
Profits fund more community work through token pool
Contributors earn tokens for valuable contributions
Successful DAHAOs get their own Avalanche subchain

Alex Example:

Invests $1,000 in DAHAO tokens
Token value increases 5x in 1 month
Alex sells $2,000, profits $1,000
$3,000 remains for community operations
Everyone wins: Alex profits + community gets resources


#### AI Agents Section - UPDATE:
Value-Differentiated AI Agents:

Personal AI: Represents your COMPLETE accepted value system
System AI: Limited to Main DAHAO values only
Cross-branch collaboration through token incentives
AI analysis funded by community token pool


**Content to PRESERVE:**
- "Surf, Don't Build" philosophy
- All existing good philosophical content
- Existing styling and components
- Core mission statements

### 2. HOW IT WORKS (/how-it-works) - Complete Restructure

**Current Problems:**
- GitHub Actions workflow focused (outdated)
- Uses incorrect "sponsor system" language
- No personal branch development workflow
- Missing token economics integration

**New Structure Required:**

Personal DAHAO Creation & Configuration
Term & Ethics Development in Personal Workspace
Progressive Governance Pipeline:

Personal Development
Public Pool Community Review
Investment Pool Funding (NOT sponsor approval)
Governance Decision Making


AI Agent Value Differentiation & Token-Incentivized Deployment
Token Economics & Avalanche Subchain Creation
Dual Benefit Growth Cycle & Network Effects


**Critical Economic Updates:**
REMOVE ALL: References to "sponsor system", "sponsor approval", "budget allocation"
ADD: Token Economics Section:

Investment pools managed by token holder governance
Contributor rewards through token distribution
Avalanche subchain creation when criteria met
Dual benefit: investor profits + community resources
Alex example showing win-win economics


**Content to PRESERVE:**
- Technical implementation vision
- GitHub/Claude Code integration mentions
- MCP server concepts (but update economic integration)

### 3. AI AGENTS (/agents) - Value System & Token Integration

**Current Problems:**
- Missing value differentiation explanation
- No token-incentivized deployment
- No connection to investment pool funding

**Required Updates:**

#### Personal vs System AI:
Personal Agents:

Represents user's COMPLETE accepted value system
Can use personal term extensions and modifications
Deployable across branches for token rewards
Funded by community investment pool

System Agents:

Limited to Main DAHAO values ONLY
Conservative baseline evaluation
Cannot use personal extensions
Maintains system integrity


#### Token Integration:
AI Agent Economics:

Deploy agents to help other branches → earn tokens
Quality analysis increases token rewards
Cross-branch collaboration incentivized
Investment pool funds AI infrastructure costs


### 4. TERMS (/terms) - Democratic Evolution & Token Governance

**Current Problems:**
- Presented as static dictionary
- No connection to token governance
- Missing investment pool funding for term development

**Required Updates:**
Terms-as-Discussions with Token Economics:

Democratic term evolution through community voting
Quality term development rewarded with tokens
Investment pool funds serious term research
Token holders vote on term ratification
Personal branch development incentivized

Term Evolution Process:

Personal development in branch
Public pool community review
Investment pool funding for promising terms
Token holder voting for ratification
Contributors earn tokens for accepted terms


### 5. OUR MISSION (/our-mission) - Investment Model Integration

**Updates Needed:**
ADD: Dual Benefit Economics

Replace any sponsor references with investment pool language
Add Avalanche subchain automatic deployment
Include token holder governance concept
Maintain all existing philosophical content

PRESERVE: All core philosophy about "Surf, Don't Build"

## Implementation Guidelines

### Critical Requirements:
1. **COMPLETELY REMOVE** all "sponsor" and "sponsorship" language
2. **PRESERVE** existing good philosophical content
3. **ADD** token economics throughout all pages
4. **INTEGRATE** Alex investment example where appropriate
5. **MAINTAIN** consistency with dual benefit model

### Key Terms to Use Consistently:
- "Investment pools" (NOT sponsor system)
- "Token holder governance" (NOT sponsor approval)
- "Dual benefit model" (investors profit + community resources)
- "Personal DAHAO branches" (NOT forum-like platform)
- "Value-differentiated AI agents"
- "Avalanche subchain creation"
- "Progressive governance pipeline"

### Token Economics Integration:
- Every page should mention how contributors earn tokens
- Investment pool funding replaces sponsor concepts
- Token holder voting replaces sponsor approval
- Dual benefit model emphasized throughout
- Alex example used to show win-win economics

### Content Integration Strategy:
- Use Alex example to demonstrate dual benefit model
- Show how token value growth funds community work
- Explain Avalanche subchain creation process
- Connect AI agents to token-incentivized deployment
- Maintain technical accuracy while keeping accessible

## Success Criteria:
- Zero references to "sponsor system" anywhere
- Clear explanation of dual benefit token economics
- Alex investment example integrated appropriately
- Token reward system for contributors explained
- Avalanche subchain creation process clear
- All content consistent with investment pool model

## Files to Update:
- `/` (Home page) - Major economic model updates
- `/how-it-works` (Complete restructure) - Remove sponsor, add token economics
- `/agents` (AI agents page) - Add token integration
- `/terms` (Terms page) - Add token governance
- `/our-mission` (Minor updates) - Economic model alignment

## Final Quality Check:
- Search for any remaining "sponsor" references and remove
- Ensure Alex example appears appropriately
- Verify dual benefit model is consistent across pages
- Confirm token economics integration throughout
- Test that investment pool concept is clear and compelling
