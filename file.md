# Goal: Update Animal Welfare DAHAO with Turkey Street Animal System

## Overview
We need to add a new discussion and ethics principle to the Animal Welfare DAHAO governance structure. This represents a real-world implementation proposal for managing street animals in Turkey through municipal veterinary services with blockchain verification.

## Tasks

### 1. Create New Discussion File
**Path:** `animal-welfare/discussions/street-animals/turkey-municipal-vet-system.md`

Create a new discussion following the existing format that includes:
- Municipal veterinary registration system for Turkey
- Blockchain-based treatment tracking
- Transparent donation mechanism
- Medical data sharing protocols
- Implementation phases (pilot → regional → national)

Key components to include:
- Treatment records stored on blockchain
- Direct donation system to municipal vets
- Public access to anonymized treatment data
- Cost verification and transparency
- Integration with existing Five Freedoms framework

### 2. Create New Ethics Principle
**Path:** `animal-welfare/ethics/v1.0/emergency-care-protocol.yml`

Add a new ethics principle for emergency care that includes:
- Emergency categories (life-threatening, urgent, preventive)
- Financial protocols for emergency funds
- Provider verification requirements
- Cross-domain coordination with public health
- Validation rules for emergency treatments

### 3. Update Inheritance File
**Path:** `animal-welfare/inheritance.yml`

Add to the `domain_extensions` section:
```yaml
emergency_care_protocol:
  version: "1.0"
  description: "Rapid response framework for animal emergencies"
  status: "domain_specific"

municipal_integration:
  version: "1.0"
  description: "Framework for municipal veterinary service integration"
  status: "domain_specific"
Add to the specialization section:
yamlmunicipal_coordination:
  government_liaison: "required_for_municipal_programs"
  public_health_integration: "mandatory_for_street_animals"
  emergency_response: "24_7_capability_required"
Implementation Notes

Follow existing patterns: Look at other discussions and ethics files for formatting consistency
Maintain version compatibility: Ensure all references to other principles use correct versions
Include realistic data: The discussion should feel like a real community debate with multiple perspectives
Add AI agent analysis: Include structured YAML responses from relevant AI agents
Keep blockchain details practical: Focus on what data goes on-chain vs off-chain

Expected Outcome
After these changes:

The forum will display a new discussion about Turkey's street animal system
A new emergency care protocol will be available in the ethics framework
The system will support municipal vet integration and blockchain verification
The changes will be compatible with existing Five Freedoms and Welfare Measurement principles

Validation Checklist

 New discussion file created with proper markdown formatting
 Emergency care protocol YML follows existing schema
 Inheritance.yml updated without breaking existing structure
 All cross-references use correct version numbers
 File paths match the expected structure
 YAML syntax is valid in all files
