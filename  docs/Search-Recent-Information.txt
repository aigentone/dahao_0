üí° Pro Tip for Claude Code
When encountering errors or implementing new features:

First: Check if there's a pattern in existing codebase
Then: Search for recent best practices and solutions
Finally: Adapt the solution to match project patterns

The DAHAO codebase follows consistent patterns - understanding these patterns first, then enhancing them with current best practices, will yield the best results.
