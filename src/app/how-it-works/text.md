"Governance That Actually Works
Traditional governance is broken. Rules sit in dusty documents. Decisions take forever. Enforcement is inconsistent. Communities struggle with outdated systems that can't keep pace with their evolving needs.
Enter DAHAO: Living Governance
DAHAO transforms governance from static text into living, breathing systems. Instead of rules that people must manually interpret and enforce, DAHAO creates executable workflows that run automatically, adapt intelligently, and evolve with your community.
It's Like GitHub Meets Democracy Meets AI
Imagine if:
* Rules could enforce themselves - No more "who's responsible for this?"
* Any community could fork and customize - Like creating your own branch of governance
* AI could help, not replace human judgment - Connect any AI model to assist decision-making
* Changes happen through code-like workflows - Drag and drop, or describe in plain English
Three Revolutionary Concepts
1. Executable Rules 🚀 Your rules aren't just text - they're programs. When someone submits a proposal, the rule automatically checks requirements, notifies stakeholders, analyzes impact, and executes decisions. No manual overhead.
2. Branch Your Governance 🌳 Just like code, governance can branch. Start from a template or fork an existing system. Experiment freely in your branch. Merge successful innovations back to the community. Every group finds their perfect governance.
3. AI-Powered, Human-Controlled 🤖 Connect any AI model or tool to your governance. Use GPT-4 for analysis, Claude for research validation, or your custom models for specialized tasks. AI assists but never decides - humans remain in control.
From Idea to Action in Minutes, Not Months
Watch how a simple wildlife protection rule comes to life:
"When someone proposes development in protected areas, check species database, analyze environmental impact with satellite imagery, get expert review, and require 80% community approval if endangered species are affected."
In DAHAO, this becomes an actual workflow that runs automatically - no committees, no delays, no confusion about process.

The Technical Architecture: How DAHAO Actually Works
The Four Layers of Living Governance
1. Terms (@) - The Shared Language
Every governance system needs clear definitions. In DAHAO, Terms are versioned, trackable definitions that everyone agrees on.
@harm@2.0.0 = "Physical damage, psychological distress, or systemic disadvantage"
@transparency@2.1.0 = "Open access to information, decision processes, and outcomes"
@consensus@1.5.0 = "Agreement threshold defined by branch governance"
Why this matters: Terms evolve safely with full version control. Wildlife Protection branch might extend @harm@2.0.0 to @harm@2.0.0-wp.1 to include "habitat destruction." Each branch adapts terms to their context while maintaining compatibility with parent branches.
2. Principles (#) - The Guiding Values
Principles use Terms to express your community's values. They're not enforceable directly - they guide the creation of Rules.
#minimize-harm@2.0.0 = "All actions should minimize @harm@2.0.0 to all @beings@1.0.0"
#transparency-default@1.0.0 = "All processes must maintain @transparency@2.1.0 unless explicitly justified"
Think of Principles as your constitution - the core values that all Rules must respect, with careful version management for stability.
3. Rules - The Executable Workflows
This is where DAHAO gets revolutionary. Rules are actual workflows that run automatically. Two ways to create them:
Visual Builder (like Zapier/n8n):
[Trigger: New proposal] → [Check: Budget > $10k?] → [Action: Expert review]
                                    ↓
                        [Action: Standard approval]
Natural Language:
"When someone submits research, verify their credentials, check peer-review status, and require expert validation if it claims breakthrough findings"
DAHAO converts this to executable steps using available tools, with full version tracking:
javascriptRule: "Research Validation"@3.2.1
Dependencies: {
  @credibility-standards@2.0.0,
  #evidence-based-decisions@1.5.0
}
4. Meta-rules - The System Rules
Meta-rules govern how the governance system itself works:

How Rules interact (precedence, conflicts)
What can be changed (some safety rules are immutable)
How branches inherit from parents
Permission hierarchies

javascriptMetaRule: "Version Compatibility"@1.0.0
"Child branches must use parent Term versions or compatible extensions"

MetaRule: "Voting Thresholds"@1.5.0
"Major changes require 60% approval (increased from 51% in v1.0.0)"
Version Control: Everything Evolves Safely
Every Element is Versioned
Just like Git, DAHAO tracks every change:
javascript// Terms evolve over time
@transparency@1.0.0 = "Open access to information"
@transparency@2.0.0 = "Open access to information and decision processes"
@transparency@2.1.0 = "Open access to information, decision processes, and outcomes"

// Branch-specific versions
Core DAHAO:
  @harm@2.0.0 = "Physical damage, psychological distress..."

Animal Welfare Branch:
  @harm@2.0.0-aw.1 = Core definition + "disruption of natural behaviors"

Wildlife Protection Sub-branch:
  @harm@2.0.0-aw.1-wp.3 = Parent definition + "habitat destruction"
Version Features
Compatibility Checking:
javascriptRule: "Environmental Assessment"@4.1.0
Requires: {
  @harm >= 2.0.0,
  #transparency-default >= 1.0.0
}
Rollback Capability:
javascript// Something broke? Instant restoration
Rule: "Budget Approval"
Current: 2.5.0 (broken)
Action: Rollback to 2.4.3
Status: ✅ Restored
Version History:
javascript@harm history:
  v1.0.0 - Initial (Core team, Jan 2024)
  v2.0.0 - Added psychological (Vote #127, Jun 2024)
  v2.0.0-aw.1 - Animal welfare extension (Branch fork, Aug 2024)
The MCP Revolution: Connect Anything
MCP Client Capabilities
Model Context Protocol (MCP) lets you connect any AI model or external service to your governance:
javascript// Connect specialized AI to your branch
{
  "id": "climate-analysis-ai",
  "type": "mcp-server",
  "endpoint": "mcp://climate-models.org",
  "capabilities": ["predict-impact", "analyze-data"],
  "permissions": ["read-proposals", "add-analysis"]
}

// Integrate existing tools
{
  "id": "company-slack",
  "type": "mcp-server",
  "endpoint": "mcp://slack.company.com",
  "capabilities": ["send-message", "create-channel"],
  "permissions": ["notify-decisions"]
}

// Use any AI model
{
  "id": "gpt-4-vision",
  "type": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-4-vision-preview",
  "permissions": ["analyze-images", "generate-reports"]
}

// Connect local models
{
  "id": "private-llm",
  "type": "local",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080",
  "permissions": ["unlimited"]
}
DAHAO as MCP Server: Governance as a Service
DAHAO is not just an MCP client - it's also a full MCP server that any AI or system can connect to:
javascript// Add DAHAO to Claude Computer Use
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dahao": {
      "endpoint": "mcp://your-dahao.org",
      "auth": "your-api-key",
      "capabilities": [
        "query-governance",
        "check-principles",
        "execute-rules",
        "propose-changes",
        "analyze-compliance"
      ]
    }
  }
}
MCP Server Capabilities
When external systems connect to DAHAO:
javascript// Available MCP tools when connecting to DAHAO
dahao.governance.query({
  branch: "environmental",
  type: "terms",
  version: "latest"
})
// Returns: All terms and their definitions

dahao.rules.simulate({
  rule: "ResourceAllocation@3.1.0",
  input: proposalData,
  dryRun: true
})
// Returns: What would happen without executing

dahao.compliance.check({
  action: "Launch new AI product",
  branch: "ai-safety",
  returnViolations: true
})
// Returns: List of principles that might be violated
Rules Using Multiple MCP Servers
Each Rule can connect to and orchestrate multiple MCP servers within its workflow:
javascriptRule: "Open Source Contribution Review"@2.1.0
Uses: {
  "github-mcp": "mcp://github.com/api",
  "copilot-mcp": "mcp://copilot.microsoft.com",
  "security-scanner": "mcp://snyk.io",
  "license-checker": "mcp://fossa.com"
}

Workflow:
1. [GitHub MCP] → Check PR details, contributor history
2. [Copilot MCP] → Analyze code quality, suggest improvements
3. [Security MCP] → Scan for vulnerabilities
4. [License MCP] → Verify dependency licenses
5. [DAHAO Internal] → Check against contribution principles
6. [Decision] → Auto-merge or request human review
How Rules Execute: The Workflow Engine
When a Rule triggers:
1. TRIGGER DETECTION
   ↓
2. VERSION CHECK (Compatible Term/Principle versions?)
   ↓
3. PERMISSION CHECK (Can this rule run here?)
   ↓
4. LOAD CONTEXT (Terms, Principles, Branch settings)
   ↓
5. EXECUTE STEPS:
   ├─ Database queries (Check existing data)
   ├─ AI analysis (Get intelligent insights)
   ├─ MCP services (Specialized tools)
   ├─ External APIs (Real-world data)
   └─ Human input (When needed)
   ↓
6. DECISION & ACTION
   ↓
7. AUDIT LOG (Full transparency)

Branch-Based Execution
Each branch maintains its own versioned governance:
Core DAHAO (@1.0.0)
├── Environmental Branch (@1.0.0-env.3.2)
│   ├── Ocean Protection (@1.0.0-env.3.2-ocean.1.5)
│   └── Climate Action (@1.0.0-env.3.2-climate.2.1)
└── Tech Governance (@1.0.0-tech.2.0)
    └── AI Safety (@1.0.0-tech.2.0-ai.4.3)
Each branch can:

Extend Terms: Add context-specific definitions with version tracking
Create Rules: Build workflows that reference specific versions
Connect Services: Add their own AIs and MCP servers
Set Permissions: Control access with version-aware policies

      "allowedInRules": ["DeforestationCheck@2.*"]
    }
  ]
}
Security & Permissions
Scoped Access Control
Every action is scoped and versioned:
javascript// Branch rule trying to access data
database.query("SELECT * FROM proposals WHERE branch = ?", [currentBranch])
// ✅ Allowed: Own branch data
// ❌ Blocked: Other branch private data

// Using AI within limits
ai.analyze(proposal, {
  model: "gpt-4",
  maxTokens: branch.getLimit("ai-tokens"),
  version: "2024-01-preview"
})
// ✅ Allowed: Within token budget
// ❌ Blocked: Exceeded monthly limit

// Version-specific permissions
if (user.hasPermission("modify-terms", "@transparency", "2.1.0")) {
  // Can only modify if has permission for this version
}
Security Scoping for MCP Access
javascript// Rule can only access MCP servers with specific permissions
Rule: "Public Proposal Review"
SecurityScope: "public-read-only"

// This rule CANNOT use:
// ❌ github.createPR()
// ❌ slack.sendDM()
// ❌ database.write()

// This rule CAN use:
// ✅ github.getPublicRepo()
// ✅ arxiv.search()
// ✅ public-llm.analyze()
Cost and Rate Limit Management
javascriptRule: "AI-Heavy Analysis"@2.0.0
MCPBudget: {
  "openai": {
    maxTokens: 50000,
    maxCost: 10.00,  // USD per execution
    fallback: "use-local-model"
  },
  "github": {
    rateLimit: "respectAPI",  // Auto throttle
    cacheResults: true
  },
  "proprietary-api": {
    requestsPerHour: 100,
    queueExcess: true  // Don't fail, just wait
  }
}

Real-World Integration Examples
1. Claude Computer Use Integration
You: "Claude, check if my research proposal complies with our bioethics principles"

Claude: [Connects to DAHAO MCP Server]
        [Queries: dahao.checkCompliance(proposal, branch="bioethics")]

"I've analyzed your proposal against the bioethics branch principles:
- ✅ Complies with #transparency-default@2.1.0
- ⚠️ Potential conflict with #minimize-harm@3.0.0
- 📋 Requires expert review per Rule: 'Genetic Research Protocol'@2.4.0"
2. Complex Multi-MCP Workflow
javascriptRule: "Security Incident Response"@4.2.0
Description: "Orchestrates multiple services for security incidents"

Workflow:
1. [PagerDuty MCP] → Create incident
2. [GitHub MCP] → Check recent commits
3. [Datadog MCP] → Pull system metrics
4. [OpenAI MCP] → Analyze logs for anomalies
5. [Slack MCP] → Create war room channel
6. [Jira MCP] → Create tracking ticket
7. [SendGrid MCP] → Email stakeholders
8. [Internal Tools] → Execute containment

Each step uses different MCP server,
all orchestrated by single DAHAO rule!
The Power of Composability
Mix and match versioned components:

Terms from Core DAHAO @2.0.0
Principles from Environmental Ethics @1.5.0
Rules you created @custom.1.0.0
AI Models via MCP (GPT-4, Claude, Local)
External Tools via MCP (Slack, GitHub, Custom)
Version Control for everything

The Network Effect
As more systems connect:
Your DAHAO ←→ Claude Computer Use
    ↕              ↕
Partner DAHAO ←→ GitHub Actions
    ↕              ↕
Industry DAHAO ←→ Slack Bots
This creates a governance mesh where:

Best practices propagate
Compliance is automated
AI assists everywhere
Governance becomes ambient

Build exactly the governance system your community needs, with the flexibility to evolve safely over time. Every change is tracked, every version is preserved, and rollback is always possible. Rules aren't just simple if-then statements, but full orchestration engines that can coordinate any service with an MCP interface.
The future: Instead of asking "Is this allowed?", systems automatically know through MCP connections to relevant DAHAOs.
