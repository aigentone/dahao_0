Task: Update Versioned Ethics Page - Focus on Natural Language Rules with Versioned Context
Core Concept Correction
The current page overemphasizes "workflows" and "automation". The real innovation is natural language rules enriched with versioned terms that AI executes with perfect contextual understanding.
Required Changes
1. Update Hero Section ✅ COMPLETED
Current:
"Imagine governance that evolves through visual workflows and natural language. DAHAO transforms your community's rules into executable governance automation—no coding required."
Change to:
"Imagine governance where AI understands your rules exactly as you intend. DAHAO enriches natural language rules with versioned terms and principles, enabling precise execution that respects your community's unique context."
2. Rename "Rules as Living Workflows" Section ✅ COMPLETED
Change to: "Rules as Living Instructions"
Update content to emphasize:

Rules are written in natural language
@terms and #principles provide precise context
AI executes with perfect understanding
Visual tools are optional helpers, not the main feature

3. Fix "Three Ways to Create Rules" Priority
Current order: Visual Builder (Primary) → Natural Language → Templates
Change to:
1. Natural Language (Primary Method)
   - Write rules as you naturally speak
   - Reference @terms and #principles inline
   - AI understands context perfectly

2. Templates (Quick Start)
   - Pre-written patterns to adapt
   - Learn by example

3. Visual Builder (Optional Tool)
   - Helps visualize rule structure
   - Not required for rule creation
4. Replace Workflow Diagrams ✅ COMPLETED
Remove: Flowchart-style workflow diagrams
Replace with: Context execution examples showing how the same rule works differently in different branches:
Rule: "Content moderation should minimize @harm"

Core DAHAO:
- @harm = "violence, hate speech"
- Execution: Remove violent content

Art Community DAHAO:
- @harm = "violence, hate speech"
- @artistic-expression = exception
- Execution: Allow artistic content even if violent

Same rule, different execution based on branch context
5. Rename "AI-Powered Workflow Tools" Section ✅ COMPLETED
Change to: "How AI Interprets Your Rules"
Focus on:

Context resolution (which version of terms to use)
Principle application (how principles guide execution)
Branch-specific interpretation
Remove emphasis on "tools" and "automation"

6. Elevate Versioning Section ✅ COMPLETED
Move "The Power of Versioned Context" higher up (after Core Philosophy).
Add emphasis on:

Versioning captures different interpretations, not just updates
Same term can mean different things to different communities
Temporal evolution (how terms change over time)
Personal interpretations coexisting

7. Replace "Executable" Language Throughout
Find and replace:

"executable workflows" → "interpretable rules"
"automated governance" → "AI-assisted governance"
"workflow execution" → "rule interpretation"
"automation" → "contextual understanding"

8. Update Examples
Current: Heavy focus on automation steps and workflow stages
Change to: Focus on how different branches interpret the same rule differently
Example format:
Rule: "Decisions should be @fair and @transparent"

Tech Startup Branch:
- @fair = "merit-based rewards"
- @transparent = "open metrics"
- Result: AI prioritizes performance data

Co-op Branch:
- @fair = "equal voice"
- @transparent = "consensus visible"
- Result: AI ensures everyone participates
9. De-emphasize Visual Builder ✅ COMPLETED
Throughout the page, make it clear that:

Writing rules in natural language is the primary method
Visual tools are helpers for those who prefer them
No visual builder needed to create sophisticated governance
Focus on the power of versioned terms, not visual interfaces

10. Update Bottom Line Section ✅ COMPLETED
Current:
"Your values become executable workflows. Your terms provide context. Your principles guide decisions."
Change to:
"Your values become natural language rules. Your versioned terms eliminate ambiguity. Your principles guide AI interpretation. Write naturally, and AI executes with your community's exact understanding—no workflows or coding required."
11. Fix FAQ Answers ✅ COMPLETED
Current: "DAHAO creates an executable workflow..."
Change to: "DAHAO enriches your natural language rule with versioned terms. When AI interprets the rule, it uses your branch's specific definitions to execute exactly as your community intends."
12. Remove Workflow-Heavy Visuals ✅ COMPLETED

Remove or minimize flowchart-style diagrams
Replace with examples showing term versioning
Show how different communities interpret the same rule
Focus on context, not process flows

Key Message Throughout
The page should communicate:

Rules are natural language (not workflows)
Terms provide versioned context (the key innovation)
AI executes with perfect understanding (not automation)
Visual tools are optional helpers (not primary interface)
Each branch has its own interpretations (community sovereignty)

Priority
Focus on explaining how versioned terms enable precise AI interpretation of natural language rules. This is the core innovation—not workflow automation.
