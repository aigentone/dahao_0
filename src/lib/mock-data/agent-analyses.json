Version 1.1.0 maintains appropriate balance between AI assistance and human authority\n2. Definition aligns with principle \"AI agents enhance human decision-making but participants maintain ultimate authority\"\n3. Term structure supports transparency through clear version control and changelog\n4. Experimental changes appropriately contained in separate branch\n5. Core version (1.1.0) preserves democratic processes while enabling AI assistance\n\nNote: The experimental branch (2.0.0-ai) would require separate validation if proposed for core adoption, as it introduces significant changes to AI agent autonomy.",

Update to version 1.2.0 with these additions:\n   - Mandatory logging of all AI agent actions and decisions\n   - Real-time transparency of AI decision-making processes\n   - Explicit harm prevention protocols including emotional/informational harm\n   - Required disclosure of AI capabilities and limitations\n   - Documentation of interaction history with participants\n\n2. Add specific clauses:\n   - \"AI agents must maintain complete transparency of their operations\"\n   - \"All AI agent actions must be recorded and accessible to participants\"\n   - \"AI agents must actively prevent all forms of harm as defined in harm@v1.3.0\"\n\n**Potential Value Conflicts:**\n- Basic definition might allow opacity in AI operations\n- No explicit protection against emotional/informational harm\n- Lacks requirements for transparency in AI-human interactions\n- Current version doesn't address personal governance autonomy\n\n**Confidence Level:** 85%\n\nReasoning: Analysis based on clear pattern of user's branch modifications emphasizing radical transparency and expanded harm prevention. High confidence in alignment with user's demonstrated values through their term modifications and principles, particularly regarding transparency and harm prevention.",
