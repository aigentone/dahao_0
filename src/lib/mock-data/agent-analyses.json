Clear definitions are essential.\n- Equality: ✅ Digital harm protection would extend safeguards equally across physical and digital spaces\n- Harm-prevention: ✅ Strongly aligns with your core value of preventing harm, but needs clear boundaries\n\n**Branch Compatibility:**\n- As part of Core DAHAO, this addition would strengthen fundamental protections\n- Vagueness could complicate enforcement and interpretation\n- Core branch requires precise, implementable definitions\n\n**Personal Recommendations:**\n1. Support the concept but request specific definition parameters:\n   - Clear categories of digital harm\n   - Measurable impact criteria\n   - Specific examples and exclusions\n2. Propose a phased implementation:\n   - Start with well-defined categories\n   - Expand based on governance feedback\n3. Add transparency requirements for harm assessment\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- Vague definitions could lead to inconsistent application\n- Risk of overreach without clear boundaries\n- Potential conflict between protection and clarity\n- Implementation challenges in Core branch\n\n**Modified Proposal Suggestion:**\n\"Digital harm shall be defined as measurable negative impacts through digital means, including but not limited to:\n- Unauthorized access to personal data\n- Deliberate service disruption\n- Verifiable economic damage through digital attacks\n- Documented psychological harassment through digital platforms\"\n\n**Confidence Level:** 85%\n\nBased on your value system, I recommend supporting this concept but pushing for more precise definition and implementation guidelines.

Version 1.1.0 maintains appropriate balance between AI assistance and human authority\n2. Definition aligns with principle \"AI agents enhance human decision-making but participants maintain ultimate authority\"\n3. Term structure supports transparency through clear version control and changelog\n4. Experimental changes appropriately contained in separate branch\n5. Core version (1.1.0) preserves democratic processes while enabling AI assistance\n\nNote: The experimental branch (2.0.0-ai) would require separate validation if proposed for core adoption, as it introduces significant changes to AI agent autonomy.",

Update to version 1.2.0 with these additions:\n   - Mandatory logging of all AI agent actions and decisions\n   - Real-time transparency of AI decision-making processes\n   - Explicit harm prevention protocols including emotional/informational harm\n   - Required disclosure of AI capabilities and limitations\n   - Documentation of interaction history with participants\n\n2. Add specific clauses:\n   - \"AI agents must maintain complete transparency of their operations\"\n   - \"All AI agent actions must be recorded and accessible to participants\"\n   - \"AI agents must actively prevent all forms of harm as defined in harm@v1.3.0\"\n\n**Potential Value Conflicts:**\n- Basic definition might allow opacity in AI operations\n- No explicit protection against emotional/informational harm\n- Lacks requirements for transparency in AI-human interactions\n- Current version doesn't address personal governance autonomy\n\n**Confidence Level:** 85%\n\nReasoning: Analysis based on clear pattern of user's branch modifications emphasizing radical transparency and expanded harm prevention. High confidence in alignment with user's demonstrated values through their term modifications and principles, particularly regarding transparency and harm prevention.",
